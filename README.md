# Machine-learning-list
List of resources i am using to understand (beacuse i dont want to use learn) machine learning.

This list is bening updated as i move to a new material or see a material i intend to read (it will be stated if so). It also includes my opinion on how these resources did or didnt help me and with projects they inspired me to do, if any.
